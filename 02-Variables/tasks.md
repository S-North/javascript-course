# Variables

## Create some variables
In JavaScript, variables are first **declared** and then a value can be **assigned** to them.

Declare a variable by using one of the variable keywords
- var
- let
- const
Then giving the variable a name e.g.
```javascript
var myVariable1
let myVariable2
const myVariable3
```

You can assign a value to a declared variable by typing the variable name, followed by the assignment operator `=` and then the new value for the variable e.g.
```javascript
var myVariable1
myVariable1 = 1
```

You can also assign a value to a variable when you declare it e.g. 
```javascript
var myVariable1 = 1
```

### Strings

1. In your main.js file
