# Functions & Events

## Functions
In JavaScript we can write blocks of code and put then in a container. Then we can call that block of code whenever we want. These containers are called Functions.
A function looks like this;
```javascript
function myFunctionName (input1, input2) {
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

    return output
}
```
We can then run this code at any time and any number of times by using its name;
`myFunctionName()`
